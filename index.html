<p>It is hard to find a pizza appreciation website since there are a million restuarnts that sells pizza and have websites, so I chose to look at <a href="https://www.dominos.com/en/"> Domino's</a> They have a lot of pictures of pizza which is good advertising. All the content on the page is styled with a consistent them. Anything that you would be looking for is easy to spot. For example "DELIVERY" and "CARROUT" are in red which is pretty easy to spot. The website doesn't use a lot of its space. This is probably because the creators do not want the reader to be distracted from what is trying to be presented. Even so, this makes everything in the middle bothersome to look at in my opinion.</p>
